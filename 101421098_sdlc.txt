SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) is the process that development teams use to create software.
Dev Ops engineers are a crucial part of the process, as without them there would not be the infrastructure required to go through the process smoothly.
If the development process isn't organized to fit the entire team, it will be a complete mess for both the developers working on the software, and the users who may rely on it.
