"DevOps," or COMP2156, is a course I'm currently enrolled in at George Brown College. 
It's focus is on developer operations engineering and the protocols, procedures, and best practices suited for the workplace environment.

Throughout the course, I've been gaining hands-on knowledge of analyzing and evaluating various DevOps implementations available. 
Additionally, I've been engaging in practical work, utilizing a suite of industry-standard tools. 
Some of the tools I've had the opportunity to use so far include GitHub and Travis CI. Moreover, I've learned about different data formats such as JSON and YAML.
