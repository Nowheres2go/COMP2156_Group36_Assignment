DevOps (Developer Operations) is a course about the tools & methods used to grant developers a synchronous workflow.
The course has had a large focus on online repositories (in our case Github) and the tools and processes that put everything together.
We need to learn these tools as they are what help automate the SDLC process, in order to minimize time spent on infrastructure, and instead maximize efficiency for development.
