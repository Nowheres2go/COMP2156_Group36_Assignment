I attend George Brown College, I'm in my 4th semester of the program Computer Systems Technology (T147) in the department of Arts, Design & Information Technology.
George Brown has provided hundreds of thousands of people with the knowledge and skills to further their careers in a specialized field. 
As a student of the college with prior tech knowledge, the past couple of years has really expanded my horizons in the world of Information Technology, with more to come as my approach my third year.
