I'm currently enrolled at George Brown College of Applied Arts and Technology. I'm in my fourth semester, which is also the last semester of my program 
(T141) Computer Systems Technician. I attend George Brown's Casa Loma Campus located at 160 Kendal Ave, Toronto, Ontario.

George Brown College was chartered in 1966 by the government of Ontario and opened in 1967 as part of the Ontario government's community college system. 
George Brown is a public college, meaning it receives a majority of its funding from the Ontario government. 
(In Canada, education is a constitutional responsibility of the individual provinces.) 
Although publicly funded like most other schools in Canada, George Brown, much like other schools, maintains institutional autonomy.
