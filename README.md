## Overview :information_source:
Each group member maintains their own branch where they are tasked with populating three text files. The primary objective of this assignment is for them to gradually add relevant information to these files over time, committing their changes as they proceed.
Upon nearing the completion of the assignment and after a specified number of commits made by each individual group member, all three branches will be consolidated into the main branch. Any conflicts arising from these merges will be carefully reviewed and resolved.
